# Temtum Decentralized Text Message Payments

## **Overview and Origin**
Temtum is a new cryptocurrency(TEM) on the temporal block chain.

Temtum has been founded 5 years ago by senior cryptography advisor Richard Dennis and CISO Dr Gareth Owenson.They are joined by Director David Shimmon and the best brains in cryptography and blockchain,alongside a senior team rich in banking infrastructure, commercial acumen and financial services experience.

Richard took theoretical mathematics and academic research and developed it into a blockchain technology known as Temporal, owned by Dragon Infosec and perpetually licensed to temtum.Temporal has been independently tested (BSI) and deployed into a live working network, providing the foundations for a fast, secure, highly scalable and environmentally conscious payment coin –
temtum.

The team has global coverage, with team members based in the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Ecuador and Belarus.

### **Temtum Vision**

Temtum’s vision is to become the most widely used cryptocurrency in
the world, adopted into mainstream payment markets by regular consumers and citizens on every continent.

Temtum team belives that there are a lot of cryptocurrencies now in existence, but critically none has yet succeeded as a mainstream form of payment used by millions of regular people around the world for everyday transactions. temtum changes all of that and represents a step changein the evolution of cryptocurrencies.

### **About the Project**
The main objective behind temtum coin is to have an efficient, quantum-secure, ultra-fast, non-resource intensive and environmentally friendly payment coin (using the acronym ‘TEM’), and an alternative to traditional fiat money(government-printed currency). It can be used on a standalone basis wallet-to-wallet, and can also be integrated into payment systems worldwide, serving as a payment platform for both consumers and businesses.

In order to achieve the above objective Temtum team developed the Temporal block chain network which addresses the below four core challenges the existing blockchain network facing.
* **Scalability** 
Current blockchain technologies are not truly scalable.They are not able to be fully decentralised and in manycases require high entry points to participate in them e.g.massive computational power.
The Temporal Blockchain eliminates the need to store the entire chain history on all nodes by locally archiving data, while preventing competition in node selection. This significantly reduces resource requirements and allows anyone with a basic form of technology – such as a smartphone user–to fully participate in the network, delivering true decentralization and infinite
scalability.

* **Speed**
Many blockchain technologies, including Bitcoin, are enormously slow. Bitcoin can take 10–15 minutes per transaction which makes it thoroughly unsuitable as a mainstream form of payment.The speed of the temtum network is limited only by the hardware and bandwidth of network participants. Temtum has created a highly efficient Consensus Algorithm and removed block size limitations in order to confirm transactions into a block extremely quickly, with a maximum confirmation time of 12 seconds.

* **Resources** temtum’s Consensus Algorithm, constructed around leader nodes and their innovative Node Participation Document,removes the need for mining and wasteful,inefficient and restrictive Consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-work. temtum uses substantially less energy and has less environmental impact compared to POW networks. Temtum team estimate that the Bitcoin network is 16,573,693 times more expensive than the temtum network based on energy costs alone,assuming both networks are operating at the same size.

* **Security** Temporal is a quantum-secure blockchain network that uses a photon source for genuine random number generation alongside next-generation hashing algorithms. These prevent the network from being vulnerable to theoretical attacks – even in the case that quantum attacks become commonplace in the near future.


## **Business Activities**

### **Financial Problems**
There are around 2 billion unbanked people in the world. Governments around the world have taken up various initiatives to make basic financial services like everyday banking accessible to them. However, providing basic financial services using traditional brick and mortar channels is unprofitable for banks, given the low amount of amounts stored and transacted by the underbanked. Though offering these services through digital and mobile technologies presents a significant opportunity, however, there still remains challenges which is making this section of population to rely fully on cash.

For example, in India alone there are 1.2 billion mobile subcriber with 50% of them living in rural area. Though 80% of indian population have bank accounts, only 50% of them are active. Some of the reason behind the low adoption of mobile based banking and financial services are

* Rural population not exposed to smartphone features like installing banking apps and managing passwords and adding payees and processing payments.
* Again, day to day transactions in rural parts of the world involve very low amount which makes the existing POS or digital money transfer methods  to be less cost effective.
* Poor or no internet availability
* Lack of trust in centralized institutions like banks
* Events like Venezuela blackouts makes even tech savy people to rely on cash.

### **Temtum solution**
Temtum coins powered by ultra low light temporal blockchain presents a cost effective solution to transactions involving low amounts. Its consesus algorithm makes gas fees almost zero making any transaction involving small amounts possible on the blockchain network.

To simplify the digital payment process temtum has come up with unique SMS transfer capability on their platform. This enables users to send money through simple sms texts. With this mode of payment there is no requiremnt  for neither any download of app nor uername and password for log-in.If the user has a device that can send an SMS text message, then they are able to use temtum. Similarly, the recipient needs neither an app nor a wallet to receive funds. This makes it suitable for non-smartphones and is targeted at countries with a high penetration rate of such devices, the use of which is driven by unpredictable electrical power and intermittent, or less widely available, high speed internet.

The SMS system facilitates instant transfers. Transactions are immediately settled directly on the Temporal Blockchain and funds are never held by a third party. SMS transfer system could be achieved between temtum wallets.

For example, a simple text message sms like "pay raj(recipient name) $2" transfers the $2 from senders temtum wallet into recipients wallet without any requirement of apps or internet availability.

This simplified text based message payment system coupled with fee less transactins would definately encourage the unbanked population to avoid cash transactions and adopt this new digital payment modes.

Temtum also offers a "Keyboard payment" system which enables people who are exposed to popular messaging platforms like whatsapp and telegram.This unique smartphone keyboard allows the user to access the benefits of the temtum application in a seamless way and can be used from any mobile messaging application, including Facebook, Whatsapp and Telegram, without the need for specialist currencies per application. It means that users can simply click on a custom temtum button and, without opening the temtum app, temtum coins (TEM) can be sent from one account to another.

The keyboard is installed as a customised keyboard service as part of the temtum application. This enables sharing of the core functionality and the stored user credentials using the most secure standards for mobile apps. The user can access the temtum transfer functionality very simply, from any application.

Both these features – the temtum application and the temtum keyboard – use the same temtum API capabilities and apply the same security standards. This design ensures data integrity between transactions either for the temtum mobile application and the temtum keyboard.

## **Landscape**

Temtum offers mainly below three products

* **Android,ios and web based wallet** This is a heavily crowded space in block chain world. There are hundreds of mobile wallets out their from different organizations. What makes temtum stand out on this space is, its ability to offer an ultra low transfer and payment fee and being capable of delivering a transaction per second rate of 120000. Also temtum transactions have been tested using the web application, mobile applications, drone, watch, raspberry Pi and even a car.

* **Keyboard payments** This is a unique feature which enables the user to use the temtum wallet through popular messaging platforms like facebook, instagram without any login requirement to temtum app.

* **SMS Transfers** As mentioned already in business activity section, this feature is very unique to temtum. There are some major competitor like samourai's Pony Direct, Dash text, XRP Text out in the market but temtum's network through out and low cost transaction rates puts it in a better position than other competitors.
 
Eeven with multiple players in this space temtum could still grab significant share of this huge market with its innovative cost effective products.


## **Results**

Temtum products are still in developement beta stage and getting ready to be rolled out. temtum has received licence to launch its payment services in some stated of africa.

But by looking at there road map and past record of hitting road map milestones concistently proves that their products would b out there in real world very soon.

Also temporal network competitive analysis published on their site further proves that its network capabilities are far superior compared to its competitors like Bitcoin, Hydera, QTUMX etc.


## **Recommendations**

* Temtum sms based system must support localized languages. This will boost the ease of adoption by its potential consumer base.
* Since the rural market around the world going to grow rapidly with new manufacturing bases, agritech adoptions , rural retails sector transformation Temtum should add SMS based smart contract capability to its platform. A real world use case would be, in India rural areas, sports betting is an unorganized sector and has been conducted orally with full reliance on cash and often trust deficiet exists between parties. A SMS smart contract system something like " If Indian wins firt ODI against Australia then pay raj $10 or else pay Adam $10" would be a great move forward to digitze this sector and would help to bring transperency and trust. A SMS based smart contract system will have unimaginable potential in enabling citizens to participate in goverment schemes which involves some form of transactions thus eliminating middlemen and lower level corruptions.
